Many small businesses come to Vulk to solve this exact problem – to improve their ads performance as they begin ramping up their spend on Amazon ads. </p><h2 class="title is-3"> Value of the Vulk bidder for small businesses </h2> <p> A new analysis shows why more and more brands are moving towards Vulk and our advanced bidding engine. Vulk’ software helps the vast majority of sellers drive dramatically more revenue in a matter of months, even if their advertising activity prior to coming to Vulk was low or non-existent. </p><p> Hundreds of sellers signed up for Vulk last year having spent $315 or less on advertising in the prior 60 days. </p><p> Just 60 days after turning on Vulk and our bidding technology, those same sellers experienced median sales jumps of more than 24X from the previous period. </p><p> For smaller sellers, this analysis shows how Vulk software can put you in the best position to scale your advertising on Amazon, and improve sales dramatically, without sacrificing time or efficiency. Even if you are new to advertising on Amazon, our software and bidding technology can help take you to the next level, and make the most out of your investment. </p><h2 class="title is-3">Methodology</h2> <p> This analysis is restricted to 350 Amazon sellers using Vulk for the first time in 2020. The data examined spans both the 60 days prior to using Vulk, along with the first 60 days using the platform and associated bidder. For ease of comparison, sellers were grouped according to their pre-Vulk advertising spend amounts. See the companion study for data on larger brands. </p>',
